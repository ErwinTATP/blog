      <description>I have many useless interests, the biggest of which is procrasitnate.
So I&amp;rsquo;ll just list some brief snippets that I might expand later.
About the ID TATP is short for triacetone triperoxide, a highly explosive organic compound. It was once a somewhat obscure name till recent years, when the terrorists found out they can produce tons of these with Walmart stuff. Like sugar, the molecule only consists of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, which means it can bypass outdated security scanners and cause tragedies in public transport.</description>

      <description>It all started with OriginLab. Or rather, the hatred towards it.
As a chemistry graduate student with limited programming experience, I had to plot and summarize huge amount of data coming from various scanners - IR, UV-Vis, Current-Voltage, NMR, you name it. And, as a chemistry graduate student trained in China, I picked up pirated versions of OriginLab as my primary tool.
Because &amp;ldquo;everyone else had been using it&amp;rdquo;, they said.</description>
