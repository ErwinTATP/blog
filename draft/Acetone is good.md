# The underground railroad of acetone deals

Although being the very foundation of organic experiments, the sale of acetone is strictly controlled in mainland China. A legal purchase would require approval from local police office, with limited allowance and long period for approval. For my master degree, my lab is so large that crates of acetone are spent every week by over 50 members, yet so obscure that the approval is much harder than the other large lab.

Therefore the research secretary from the school have to find some _underground_ ways to keep the supply of solvent. They found a friend of a friend who is a reagent retailer, hoarded countless bottles of acetone, then hid them in boxes among other "legal" solvent. Months later, they realized nobody had been tracing them or raise any issues, so they simply change the reagent label to _Solvent Cleaner \#2_ and used like nothing matters.

The lab does have another solvent labelled _Solvent Cleaner \#1_, commonly known to the outside world as Toluene. It is widely used as a much less toxic alternative to benzene and other aromatic solvents, hence considered by manufacturers as green solvent. <!-- I think merck has a list for green chemistry solvents. Find the link--> The authorities seems untouched, however, as the purchase of toluene is even more strict than acetone. Moreover, there had been no need for _Cleaner \#3_ labels  when I left the school, meaning only these two are restricted while required in large quantities.

I'm too lazy to find the exact reason behind such policies in mainland, but I have some clue from their properties and usage. Acetone is one of starting materials for TATP, a safe yet powerful explosive. It is increasingly popular in recent years terrorist attacks, thanks to the easily accessible gradients and explosive nature. As for toluene, my guess is it has something to do with Methamphetamine. It can be either used as starting material, or might be used as solvent for product purification. Perhaps acetone can also dissolve the product, I never cooked meth so I don't know.

<!--"Meth" labelled bottle from my previous lab-->

There's a reason why meth is arguably most common drug in news and Emmy-winning shows: it is effective yet surprisingly simple to make. You don't need a chemistry degree to complete its synthesis. In fact, the term "cooking" is very suitable with meth production: you don't need to grasp how the molecules interact with each other or how it affects your neurons. You just need a step-by-step "cookbook" for instructions, and all the wares and gradients are available from mundane stores. 

Finding one of such "cookbook" is easy. <!--Anarchist Cookbook, google search results--> Anyone who learned college-level organic synthesis can propose a viable synthesis route from common lab reagents. It doesn't even fit in final or midterm exams: after-class assignment is where it belongs. That is why, even with extensive internet censorship techs, time after time people were found cooking the crystal with downloaded information on underground one-on-one instructions. 

Governments around the world have to come up with other methods on meth control. Surprisingly, not so many countries favors the easiest option - "don't", even if they have nothing against alcohol and tobacco. An effective approach would be policies that allows the poor receive living expense (if you believe in welfare) or flourish small businesses that creates jobs (if you believe in free market). This is also very hard.

If the gradients for meth is prohibited or controlled, meth cooking will be considerably harder and much less lucrative. Also, for an authoritarian government that can ban unauthorized sale of cooking knives whenever it likes, anything could be dubbed as dangerous reagents that must be controlled by the state.
