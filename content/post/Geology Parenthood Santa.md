After hours of exhausting bike, I finally arrived it the Hong Kong UNISCO Global Geopark at eastern tip of Sai Kung. While I was hiking up and down along the MacLehose Trail, I began to notice something unusual about the park — its lack of local tales. From my own experience, most natural attractions have these kind of stories: this boulder looks like
a frog, which according to a local century-old legend was made to be there due to some witchcraft. This is a man, that is a woman, that is a bird, and there are no planes.

But not in the GeoPark. Here the signs only gave information: the entire reservoir (High Islands Reservoir) is located on rifts, the hexagonal stones pillars are hexagonal because of how the basalt cooled down from lava; that pillar is separator from the main island due to erosion from the sea — hence the name "sea stack" . In any other park, they would made up a story of how a significant historical figure tested his mighty sword at the poor rock. And it is always "his", not "her".

The GeoPark is only facts, and no copypasta lore. I guess it is partly use of the UNESCO nature of this place, so they had better promote scientific facts in this place (and the authorities hire did really great drawings and writings), The other aspect is that the columns were just revealed 50 years ago when removed part of the hillsides while b building the reservoir, and there was no time to create a. folklore before science intervened.

This is a natural attraction of facts: 3000 kilometers away, my parents likes it.

My parents were classmates in a geology college, among the earliest classes of geology college students after the Cultural Revolution. My dad did well in the class, yet not as good as my mother, the ace of ace in the entire college. They have been doing geology and petro-related occupations even to this day.

During the national holidays, we would travel together, and the destination would very likely be a mountain or a valley. They are very different from the usual middle-aged parents: they are never tired from climbing, even when climbing the steep Huashan Mountain — that is decades of survey does for you. The other thing is, when other people looks at features and say "that is a frog" "there is a toad", my parents would comment like "the cleavage of these rocks indicate that the lava in this place was pushed out of the ground 3 million years ago, which is a clear evidence of (insert geological events here) in this region as described in my old textbook". Whenever I asked them what kind of rock formation anything is, they would immediately provide detailed yet clear information. It is just sometimes they would talk to each on and on for quite a while — I would imagine that is what they did during their dates.

This is who they are — provide scientific information without feeling boring. People sometime argue that scientific information kills imagination of kids; from my own experience, that is only because they are horrible storytellers. When you got amazing ones like Karl Sagan or my parents, you may realize the true facts are much better than the made-up tales: the solid ground beneath my feet is moving, breathing, clashing like warriors and flame for eons. Solid for us human is in fact marshmallow for mother nature, twisted at her will and made us agape. No, I do not believe any  non—scientific writer has  ever provide epics as great as the geological textbooks. Sadly, most people using them are just are just cheap replacements of voice over programs, without a caring heart of the listener and no awareness or intention to improve themselves.

When I was in primary school, I read a lot of cartoons, most of them are American: I had Calvin & Hobbles on my bookshelf beside my textbooks, Garfield collections everywhere, a heavy book of the Peanuts, and once every year we gather all the Mickey Mouse magazine in the room and bundle them together.

And they all described a fancy festival in the west: Christmas.

I was beginning to gut curious. It was China in the early 00's, the common folk has very limited image of what a Christmas is, aside from the tree and the white bearded guy. I read the cartoon and thought, "wait we do not have this here, just what are they doing?" And because the cartoons had been published from 50s to 00s, there are similarities and differences. And one month before Christmas in my fourth grade, I had been talking all about the festival to my parents: about the tree and gift exchanging, thistle and kissing, and the gift in the awkwardly large sock by the weird old man who would step in every house in one night.

Contrary to most families where the parents tell the children the tales of Santa, I studied the tales of Santa, the customs and the history behind them, and told my parents the interesting bits. 

One day, I found a genuine Christmas sock hanging above my bed (it is still hard to find a fireplace in Chinese apartments). When I asked, my mom just said "well this year I guess Santa might come." 

I mean, not the most awkward performance I have ever seen, but still.

Then the eve finally came. I went to bed at 9, but was still awake for quite a while, then I heard them opening my bedroom door, putting stuff in the big sock, and left -— or at least trying to, when I greeted them with "I knew that all along". We all burst out laughter. In front of them, I checked the gift in my sock: there were three albums I had wanted.

We then talked for quite a while. I listened the tales from my parents' childhood, asked about their experiences from cultural revolution to modern day, and how they met and married. Finally when I was about to sleep, I asked why did they do this despite the whole Christmas thing had been almost entirely taught why me.

"We are proud of our son, that's why."

I then said I was proud and lucky to have them as my parents. I still am to this day: instead of made up characters and fictions, they gave me the real and genuine love by keeping it real in a caring way.
