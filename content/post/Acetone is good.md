Of the bucket loads of solvents I've used during my education in chemistry and my current project of device fabrication, acetone is one that fascinates me all the time. I would put it in the second place of 'My favorite solvent' tier list, second only to Dihydrogen Monoxide (a.k.a. the water we drink) and one place higher than aqua regia (that has such a badass name). 

# The amazing properties of acetone
Almost every adult knows that water cannot mix with oil, either from school education, home cooking, or cleaning that greasy patch on the cloth. And when I was beginning to learn chemistry, time after time I heard about how polar solvents never get along with non-polar solvents; like how water can be blended with alcohols but never with propane, hexane or benzene derivatives. So since the first day I'm into organic chemistry, I've build imaginary walls between groups of solvents—everything within the same circle might get alone with each other, but relation across the walls? Never gonna happen.

Then enter my highschool friend and his anecdote in our school lab: "Did you know that acetone can mix with basically anyone at any portion?"

I was quite staggered. 

We went on with whatever solvents in my high school's limited stock of solvent: it really did mix with water, alcohol and toluene. Later in my laboratory years when I met the  miscibility table of common solvents, I immediately checked the acetone column—

It is, indeed, miscible with every other solvent on the chart. Any portion of acetone and other solvent can be mixed without any separation.

However, there are other stuff that can do this, including THF, rubbing alcohol, and the most commonly, the ethanol. Yet acetone has more attractive points than the tolerance with everyone.

# Not just the tolerance
From my personal experience, the catch with miscibility charts is that it just tells you "does something mix with something else", which is more than often different from "how **well** does something **dissolve** another thing". Though both solvents are miscible with everyone else, acetone cleans marker pen writings much better than ethanol—especially if written on body. Don't ask why does that matter for me; it matters for makeup producers that they've been added in nail polish removers.

In addition to that, acetone can also dissolve ping-pong balls. I learned this from one of my professors, who dissolved some celluloid ping-pone balls in acetone, which gave him some handy fast-drying glue. He then used this makeshift glue to attache other ping-pong balls, and eventually making the crystal cell models used in his teaching.

Another thing is that, acetone is not just a solvent. It is the key gradient of [a very handy, easy-to-make high explosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone_peroxide), which I loved so much that I put into almost all my online IDs. 

# The underground railroad of acetone deals

Although being the very foundation of organic experiments, the sale of acetone is strictly controlled in mainland China. A legal purchase would require approval from local police office, with limited allowance and long period for approval. For my master degree, my lab is so large that crates of acetone are spent every week by over 50 members, yet so obscure that the approval is much harder than the other large lab.

Therefore the research secretary from the school have to find some _underground_ ways to keep the supply of solvent. They found a friend of a friend who is a reagent retailer, hoarded countless bottles of acetone, then hid them in boxes among other "legal" solvent. Months later, they realized nobody had been tracing them or raise any issues, so they simply change the reagent label to _Solvent Cleaner \#2_ and used like nothing matters.

The lab does have another solvent labelled _Solvent Cleaner \#1_, commonly known to the outside world as Toluene, which has an even more strict purchase protocol than acetone. Moreover, there had been no need for _Cleaner \#3_ labels  when I left the school, meaning only these two are restricted while required in large quantities.

I'm too lazy to find the exact reason behind such policies in mainland, but I have some clue from their properties and usage. Acetone is one of starting materials for that powerful explosive, and it is gaining popularity in recent years terrorist attacks, thanks to the easily accessible gradients and explosive nature. As for toluene, my guess is it has something to do with Methamphetamine. It can be either used as starting material, or might be used as solvent for product purification. Perhaps acetone can also dissolve the product, I never cooked meth so I don't know.

There's a reason why meth is arguably most common drug in news and Emmy-winning series: it is effective yet surprisingly simple to make. You don't need a chemistry degree to complete its synthesis. In fact, the term "cooking" is very suitable with meth production: you don't need to grasp how the molecules interact with each other or how it affects your neurons. You just need a step-by-step "cookbook" for instructions, and all the wares and gradients are available from mundane stores. 

Finding one of such "cookbook" [is easy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchist_Cookbook). Anyone who learned college-level organic synthesis can propose a viable synthesis route from common lab reagents. It doesn't even fit in final or midterm exams: after-class assignment is where it belongs. That is why, even with extensive internet censorship techs, time after time people were found cooking the crystal with downloaded information on underground one-on-one instructions. 

Governments around the world have to come up with other methods on meth control. Surprisingly, not so many countries favors the easiest option—"don't", even if they have nothing against alcohol and tobacco. An effective approach would be policies that allows the poor receive living expense (if you believe in welfare) or flourish small businesses that creates jobs (if you believe in free market). This is also very hard.

If the gradients for meth is prohibited or controlled, meth cooking will be considerably harder and much less lucrative. Also, for an authoritarian government that can ban unauthorized sale of cooking knives whenever it likes, anything could be dubbed as dangerous reagents that must be controlled by the state—just like our _number 1_ and _number 2_. That is why my old master degree lab have to go either lengthy paper checks or underground processes.

O acetone. You are so tolerant to everyone around you, that sometimes your mind blows and the world doesn't tolerate you anymore.
