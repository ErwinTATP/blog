Days ago I came upon a meme on YouTube, showing an unfortunate man struck by lightning thrice:

{{< youtube IIEokJ_ZxKE>}}

Though amusing in a dark way, many comments believed the video it based on was fake because "the ground lit up before the bolt appeared" and some other reasons. However, I recognized the Chinese watermarks in the frames, and decided to search for the original video - Chinese-speaking media cannot miss this rare news. 

It didn't work as I intended.

# Lightnening strikes, America fails

I searched "lightening strike thrice" in Chinese.[^1] All results are just different versions of two copypastas, first is about a man being struck thrice…over 10 years. 

The other one is way more interesting.

The [largest free-flying American national flag was torn in half](https://www.businessinsider.com/largest-american-flag-ripped-in-half-after-storm-2020-6) in a severe storm in June. Considering all the turbulence in 2020, it is natural that people saw it as a sympol of the current rift in America society. Interestingly, many Chinese media somehow added to the news that "the Washington monument was struck by lightening 3 times in a week" and "two *White House guards \[sic\]* also struck by lightening".

I immediately wanted to slam "citation needed" templates to these articles.

All the fact checks aside, I'm quite surprised if a thunderstorm happened and the monument isn't struck 3 times in less an hour. The Washington Monument is a 150+ meter tall rod with nothing of comparable height in the entire DC. From further searches, I found [this amazing analysis article about the lightening strikes near the monument](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/06/09/lightning-strikes-washington-monument/). It is estimated that the monument is struck 0.2 ~ 2 times per year, and records did imply that it might had been [struck 6 times in a single storm](http://ira.usf.edu/CAM/exhibitions/1998_12_McCollum/supplemental_didactics/14.Colton.pdf). As for the two unfortunate guards, the Chinese media dubbed them as "White House guards" to make it sound like their only duty was to guard the White House and the President inside it (or rather, underneath it). While in were indeed deployed at Lafayette Park near the White House, they were **national guards** that has lots of other things to do. 

On the other hand, lets not forget that the Canton Tower [keeps being attacked by multible thunderbolts almost every year](https://www.hk01.com/%E5%A4%A7%E5%9C%8B%E5%B0%8F%E4%BA%8B/483141/%E7%B6%B2%E6%B0%91%E6%8B%8D%E5%88%B0%E5%BB%A3%E5%B7%9E%E5%A1%94-%E8%A2%AB%E9%9B%B7%E5%8A%88-%E5%85%A8%E9%81%8E%E7%A8%8B-%E5%AE%98%E6%96%B9%E6%BE%84%E6%B8%85-%E6%98%AF%E4%B8%BB%E5%8B%95-%E6%8E%A5%E9%96%83-%E9%81%BF%E9%9B%B7). If the same editors had been asked to apply the same logic on that event, the implications would be embarrassing to say the least. More embarassingly, if God is warning America with a common thunderstorm near the capital, what is He trying to say to China if He flooded 27 out of 34 provinces?

But no. They say that Canton Tower is not struck by lightning; it's designed to *catch* the arcs deliberately, thus another marvel of modern Chinese constructions. As for the flood, look at how well the Party and armed forces handled it! That again, is a definitive proof that the might of the leaders knows no bonds.

Yep, the parrot's not dead, just resting.[^2]

# How many characters on this rock?
Using nonsense as weapon against others will only result in backfires. On the one hand you have quasi-official writers linking unrelated stuff as ominous sign against the "enemies"; on the other side, here's the Epoch Times, THE export at depicting natural phenomenons as heavenly signs against communist party.

The bolts of nonsense reminded me of [a "natural marvel" in Guizhou province](t.ly/wUFO) I heard back in middle school years. Years of erosion and sedimentation has formed several character-resembling patterns on a rock; however, the Party and their opposition seems have difficulties on counting these formations.

{{< figure src="/post/Destiny from Heaven_files/129440c9ddfg214.jpg" alt="The 'savior rock' as dubbed by the locals" position="center" style="border-radius: 4px;" caption="How many characters are there on this rock?" captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: blue;" >}}

According to the Party-owned media, the rock clearly carries 5 characters 中國共產黨 (Chinese Communist Party), which was "formed without any artificial interventions" according to the invited "experts". They even made documentaries on how the patterns formed "completely by natural forces", with the chance "1 in 1 trillion but still possible". 

Soon afterwards, the Epoch Times hopped on the bandwagon: they say there's actually 6 characters - 中國共產黨亡, meaning "Chinese Communist Party **Collapses**". They didn't even need to prepare their own material, as the state-run media already made tons of pictures and videos of the site with the 亡-like pattern clearly visible. They also agree the patterns are formed by nature, since the omen has spoken the downfall of the communists.

Disappointingly, geochemists from Chinese Academy of Sciences had [already debunked the entire drama](http://web.archive.org/web/20191017070819/http://tigerliuhu.blog.sohu.com/240438504.html) almost immediately after the rock's discovery: the rock is mainly limestone, which can be eroded by all-natural acid rain (which Guizhou has a lot) or man-made acids like vinegar (which Guizhou also has a lot). If patterns or slogans were drawn with less erosive substances like paint or simply mud, areas underneath the pattern will be protected from dissolving, eventually creating rough relief on the eroded surface. Unsurprisingly, nobody listened to the boring version: the Epoch Times keeps bringing up more and more "local legends descended from ancestors", while the academia were told to "be consistent with the government's narrative".

That is, treat it in the same way as everything happening behind the great wall.

[^1]: Here's a thing of news websites all over the world: they tend to complete overhaul every 3 to 4 years, so the links saved for future reference will only end up in 404 pages. Even worse for Chinese users is that most web archives (like archive.org) have been banned in mainland, meaning I'm very likely to end up with nothing useful. To add to the miserable state, floods of web spiders will grab the site contents before the original went down, in order to copy paste into their "own content", or just promote a gambling/porn site. Therefore if you want to search something in Chinese, it's better to make keywords as succinct as possible.
