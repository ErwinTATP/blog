I have many useless interests, the biggest of which is procrasitnate.

So I'll just list some brief snippets that I might expand later.

# About the ID
TATP is short for [triacetone triperoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone_peroxide), a highly explosive organic compound. It was once a somewhat obscure name till recent years, when the terrorists found out they can produce tons of these with Walmart stuff. Like sugar, the molecule only consists of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, which means it can bypass outdated security scanners and [cause tragedies in public transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Brussels_bombings). In fact, I often find my ID not available as user name in some online games unless I change the "TATP" to something else.

So I have to make a disclaimer that none of these tragedies had happened when I first encountered it over a decade ago. It was mentioned in a Chemistry Olympiad tutorial I had as "entropy bomb" for its strange explosion behavior. While most explosives produces massive amount of heat and obvious flames during explosion, TATP decomposes into loads of gasses instantly with little heat exchange. The text used it as an extreme example that, a spontaneous chemical reaction doesn't necessary require heat changes, as the changes in entropy alone is sufficient to drive an instant decomposition. Besides, I was attracted to its exotic molecular structure: its symmetry and the rare nine-membered-ring has made almost every organic chemistry professionals I've met gasp at its beauty. A decade later, I still kept the TATP part despite its unfortunate linkage: I see it as a reminder of the power of chemistry and responsibility of chemists.

# So you are a chemist then?
I don't think I am one. In fact, I wish I would know what I am. But currently, I have no idea.

## My studies
I have take chemistry as my major since 2011 and is still studying in this area. Though I am still a nobody, I love the subject and the limited achievements I made in this field. 

However, for most of the time my devotion to this subject is half-hearted. Despite my degrees in organic chemistry, I haven't done any synthesis aside from the mandatory courses in undergraduate studies. 

I spent several years on how to grow organic single crystals alone, then started research on organic field effect transistors. These subjects requires sufficient knowledge on semiconductor physics and physical chemistry, which, judging by my horrible undergraduate transcript, is clearly lacking from me.

## Astronomy society
For undergraduate study I somehow became a member of the astronomy society in my university, successfully observed several meteor showers and [a total lunar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2011_lunar_eclipse). Perhaps the highest achievement of my life currently is seeing transit of Venus twice, the first time [in 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_transit_of_Venus) and the second time [in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_transit_of_Venus).  I am not sure if I can see a third time when it happen again in 2117. 

## Wikipedia
Back in undergraduate years I tried to improve my English by translating Wikipedia articles, yet after translating an lengthy article I thought "I'd better took a rest" and went into a 3-year hiatus. Since 2018 I've restarted translation project, mainly focus on Holocaust in Poland , and the Apollo Project. 

Translations reached "good article" or above:
1. [Treblinka Concentration Camp](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%89%B9%E9%9B%B7%E5%B8%83%E6%9E%97%E5%8D%A1%E7%81%AD%E7%BB%9D%E8%90%A5)
2. [Pete Conrad](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9A%AE%E7%89%B9%C2%B7%E5%BA%B7%E6%8B%89%E5%BE%B7)

## Tifosi
My Wikipedia account actually started in order to complete Enzo Ferrari article on Chinese Wikipedia. 12 years later, the article is still unfinished, and the pathetic state of Scuderia Ferrari has quenched my mood on finishing that.

Schumi didn't wake up for this.

## Have you won anything from all these?

I am [TIME's Person of the Year 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20130824225114/http://www.time.com:80/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570810,00.html). 

# Your name?

Not giving it out. 

This is actually one of the reasons I've started this blog: I always wanted to write freely outside the wall, which would certainly include politic topics. If I give out too much personal info and I'll be in actual danger. 

I'm not expecting anyone to actually read this, though.
